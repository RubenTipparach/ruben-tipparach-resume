# ruben-tipparach-resume
A resume repo for my stuff.

- Uses resume-cli, if you want to try it, go here: https://github.com/jsonresume/resume-cli
- Make yourself a persistent online resume, that is way cooler than a word document.
- Access this webpage here: https://rubentipparach.github.io/ruben-tipparach-resume/

# Plugins
The plugin system allows you to install other themes. The way I got them to work is to 
- install resume-cli locally
- install plugins locally
- move theme/plugin files from local `node_modules` folder to `%AppData%\Roaming\npm\node_modeules`
